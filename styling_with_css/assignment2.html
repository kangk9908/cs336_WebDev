      Calvin’s logotype is called the nameplate and includes “Calvin” and “University” set in specific and unchanging
      typographical styling and placements. The placement of “Calvin” and “University” varies depending on the logo
      format but they always exist together. “Calvin” is a highly customized type treatment derived from the font
      Constantia, demonstrating both tradition and progress, while “University” is set in a modified Gotham font. Unlike
      the former nameplate for Calvin College, this nameplate is not designed to be used on its own, but in any of the
      approved arrangements with the wayfinder.
